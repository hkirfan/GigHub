GigHub is a mini social network that makes it really easy
for live music lovers to track the gigs of their favorite
artists.
Artists can sign up and list their gigs. When adding a gig,
they should specify the date/time, location and genre of
the gig.
An artist should have a page called My Upcoming Gigs.
From there, they should be able to edit or remove an
existing gig, or add another gig to the list.
Users should be able to view all upcoming gigs or search
them by artist, genre or location. They should be able to
view details of a gig and add it to their calendar.
Additionally, users should be able to follow their favorite
artists. When they follow an artist, they should see the
upcoming gigs of their favorite artists in the Gig Feed.
